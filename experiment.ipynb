Here, we use short pure tones as stimuli and a silent sound object, which is fed to the audiostream between stimuli. In our setup, we found this to be necessarry to reduce undesired clicking sounds at stimulus on- and offset, even though the sounds are ramped. Whether this will be necessary for you, will strongly depend on your audio hardware. \n",

Feel free to change the code if you prefer the other solution. Secondly, the MATLAB version stimulates at fixed time intervals and the sample rate of the video tracking is locked to the stimulation interval, i.e. high temporal precision in the sound stimulation comes with the cost of lower temporal resolution of the animal tracking. Here, we chose the opposite approach, with the video feed defining the cycle frequency (approx. 14 Hz with the given Camera and a resolution of 800x600 px) and the audio stimulation being locked to the framerate of the camera. Thus, higher temporal resolution of the animal tracking comes with the cost that inter-stimulus intervals cannot freely be chosen, but only be multiple integers (3 or higher) of the mean video frame duration. In the example setup and the code below, we decided for the stimulus to be played every three cycles (approx. every 215 ms). \n",
